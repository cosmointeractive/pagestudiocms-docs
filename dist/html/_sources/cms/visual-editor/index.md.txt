Visual Editor 
=============

The Visual Editor provides an intuitive and easy to use User Interface (UI) for building different page layouts by combining blocks together. Blocks render content with HTML elements embedded. Each block comes with its own default HTML template (commonly referred to as a [block-template](http://#)) and typically includes various customization options such as margin, padding, etc.

For a complete list of available blocks see the [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/general/blocks.html#avaiable-blocks) page under the support site.
