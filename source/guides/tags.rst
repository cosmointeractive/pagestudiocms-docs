=====================

PageStudio uses the PyroCMS Lex Parser. Tags allow you to tap into more advanced functionality using simple syntax right inside your layouts, page layouts, and even pages themselves. Tags can allow you to do some really powerful things without crowding your layouts with messy PHP code.

The following guide will teach you the basics of tags and how to use them in your layouts.

Basic Tags
######

At their very basic form, tags are simply a variable:

:: 
  
    {{ my_var }}

When you put that in your markup, it will be replaced by some value. Pretty simple!

.. note:: The white-space inside the curly braces is optional, but does help with aesthetics and readability.
